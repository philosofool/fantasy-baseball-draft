# fantasy-baseball-draft

This is the first respository created on GitHub by @philosofool. I'm still learning a lot and this rather complex project for personal stuff seemed like a good way to learn. I have been in a competitive fantasy baseball league with 14 friends since 2007 and have increasingly used Python to help manage my participation for about half of that time.

> My github doubles as a job portfolio right now. __This is an example of the sort of work that I did for many years as a Python hobbyist.__ The Version2.0 branch--unfinished--represents a little bit of how I would like to refine the stuff here. In there, [name_handler.py](https://github.com/philosofool/fantasy-baseball-draft/blob/Version2.0/CBS_fantasy_baseball/file_handlers/name_handler.py) is a good example of the sort of documented, modular code that I can write. 

There's a lot of clean up that needs to be done because I worked on this on and off for several years without any VCS. I'm slowly getting this code into shape from something that starts to look like production software.'

Someday I might try to get some of this baseball stuff into a real package for others to use. I welcome suggestions to my code, etc., but I know better than to think anyone is going to sit and read it for fun.
