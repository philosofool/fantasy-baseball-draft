# fantasy-baseball-draft

This is the first respository created on GitHub by @philosofool. This rather complex project for personal stuff seemed like a good way to learn. I have been in a competitive fantasy baseball league with 14 friends since 2007 and have increasingly used Python to help manage my participation for about half of that time.
