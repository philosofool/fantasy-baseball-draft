# fantasy-baseball-draft

This is the first respository created on GitHub by @philosofool. I'm still learning a lot and this rather complex project for personal stuff seemed like a good way to learn. There's a lot of clean up that needs to be done because I worked on this on and off for several years without any VCS. 

Someday I might try to get some of this baseball stuff into a real package for others to use. I welcome suggestions to my code, etc., but I know better than to think anyone is going to sit and read it for fun.
